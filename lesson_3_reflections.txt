When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    so you can share you work, collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    you never know when you will have a logical seperation in code implementation of bug fix

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is like branching but is done on github to copy a repository.
    clone will bring down a repository from github
    branching allows for a local fork of the code to make changes, fix bugs, add feature
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you can track changes to revert to a known good state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    copy files back and forth. It would make it very hard.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
